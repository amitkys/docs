## Persistence in SabnamAI
Persistence were important concern when students attempting a test series.

We must have to ensure that **test series**, **questions** and **user attempts** are stored reliably  
and remain consistent on:
- *Page Refresh*
- *Internet connection lost*
- *Closing & Reopen Browswer*
- *Another/Different Device*

### The Response that I care.
