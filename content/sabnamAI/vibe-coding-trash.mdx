## Initial Architecture

In the early phase, **the database schema was not fully optimized.**

The relationships between:
- Test series
- Questions
- Attempts

were loosely defined.

Database was generated by AI, I ship a lot, not just feature but I were add lots of test series in db too. 
It was working smoothly for almost 6 months, then student came for different exam, they demand  different type of test series, my 
db was not ready for this, hence, my complete backend code, db schema, types definition, ui component all suddently become irrelevant, and my project collapse.

### Lessons ?

I should have to build system. which support flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. (I know these words might sound boring initially, but those who got taste, knows better.)

## How did I overcome it?
